# Earning Call Transcripts scraping

The following script will web scrape the earnings call transcripts from seekingalpha.com.

The transcripts will be saved into a html file.   

Will need to install necessary libraries if not already installed.

pip install scrapy
pip install slugify
```

To test run python script.  
Go to folder Scrapy tool.  
Run **earnings.py** script.  

If you wish to run the full script set debug_mode variable to **False.**
